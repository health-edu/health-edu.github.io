	<p>
	<li><h3>A broad and positive health concept:-</h3>
	Positive Health is a broader perspective on health, elaborated in six dimensions. This broader approach contributes to people’s ability to deal with the physical, emotional and social challenges in life. And to be in charge of their own affairs, whenever possible.
	</li>
	<li><h3>Participation and involvement:-</h3>
	Community participation is widely believed to be beneficial to the development, implementation and evaluation of health services. However, many challenges to successful and sustainable community involvement remain. Importantly, there is little evidence on the effect of community participation in terms of outcomes at both the community and individual level. Our systematic review seeks to examine the evidence on outcomes of community participation in high and upper-middle income countries.
	</li>
	<li><h3>Action and action competence:-</h3>
	The combination of a health curriculum and health-promotion activities enables students to build action competencies and individual health skills.
	An action competence is the ability to plan, initiate, deliver and evaluate actions aimed at improving health and wellbeing in “real life”. For children at schools, this could involve actions at a classroom level or a local community level. Action competencies always address causes for health and wellbeing, rather than individual health skills alone.
	</li>
	<li><h3>A setting perspective:-</h3>
	Healthy Settings, the settings-based approaches to health promotion, involve a holistic and multi-disciplinary method which integrates action across risk factors. The goal is to maximize disease prevention via a "whole system" approach. The settings approach has roots in the WHO Health for All strategy and, more specifically, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. Healthy Settings key principles include community participation, partnership, empowerment and equity.
	</li>
	<li><h3>Equity in health:-</h3>

	Health equity means ensuring that everyone has the chance to be as healthy as possible. However, factors outside of a person’s control, such as discrimination and lack of resources, can prevent them from achieving their best health. Working toward health equity is a way to correct or challenge these factors.Health equity means ensuring that everyone has the chance to be as healthy as possible.
