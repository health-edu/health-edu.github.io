 	mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".
 	A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. 
	Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical
	 exercise and adequate sleep,and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations,
	 such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices,
	 such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes,
	 such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get
	 necessary healthcare services. Still other factors are beyond both individual and group choices,
	 such as genetic disorders. <b><i>For more Information Click Here-><a href="HT.html">Health</a></i></b><font face="arial" color="#DCA50C"><li><dt><h2><b>History of health :</b></h2></dt></li></font><font color="#043B7C" face="arial"><b>   The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective,
	 early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function;
	 health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease.
	 An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic,
	 and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles;
	 ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress".
	 Then, in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
	proposed a definition that aimed higher, linking health to well-being, in terms of "physical, mental,
	 and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".Although this definition
	 was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized for being vague and excessively broad and
	 was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal, with most discussions
	 of health returning to the practicality of the biomedical model.   </b></font><font face="veranda" color="#043B7C"><i><b> For more Information Click Here-></font><a href="history.html">History<?b></i></a></b><font face="arial" color="#DCA50C"><li><dt><h2><b>Importance of Health Education:</b></h2></dt></li></font><font color="#043B7C" face="arial"><b>   Health education builds student's  knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes about health.
	 Health education teaches about physical, mental, emotional and social health. It motivates students
	 to improve and maintain their health, prevent disease, and reduce risky behaviours.
	Health education curricula and instruction help students to learn skills so that they will
	 use to make healthy choices throughout their lifetime.
	Health education is vital for students as it builds their knowledge and attitudes about health.
	 Health education does not only concentrate on being healthy. It also focuses on emotional,
	 mental and social health too. Educating students on the importance of health builds their motivation.
	 As a result, they strive to maintain good health, prevent diseases and avoid risky behaviour.
	 Instilling the importance of good health in schools, helps students to make healthy life choices
	 when they grow older and continue doing so throughout their lives. It helps them understand the
	 dangers of using illicit drugs, smoking and drinking alcohol. It helps prevent various injuries, diseases,
	 such as, obesity and diabetes, and sexually transmitted diseases.   </b></font><font face="veranda" color="#043B7C"><i><b>For more Information Click here-></font><a href="IMP2.html"><i>Importance</i></b></i></a>
