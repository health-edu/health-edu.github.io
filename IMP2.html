	<font color="#043B7C" face="arial">  Health education is a profession of educating people about health.
	 Areas within this profession encompass environmental health, physical health,
	 social health, emotional health, intellectual health, and spiritual health,
	 as well as sexual and reproductive health education.    </font><hr style="color:gold;background-color:gold;">

	<font color="#DCA50C" face="arial "><li><b><h3>Importance of health Education :</h3></b></li></font>
	<font color="#043B7C" face="arial">   Health education builds student's knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes about health.
	 Health education teaches about physical, mental, emotional and social health. It motivates
	 students to improve and maintain their health, prevent disease, and reduce risky behaviours.   </font><hr style="color:gold;background-color:gold;">


	<font color="#DCA50C" face="arial"><li><b><h3>Role of the Health Education Specialist :</h3></b></li></font>
	<font color="#043B7C" face="arial">  A health educator is "a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety
	 of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods
	 to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive
	 to the health of individuals, groups, and communities" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p. 100).
	 In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and
	 responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of
	 Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985).
	 A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the 
	Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996).
	 These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below.
	 The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced "a new
	 hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies". </font>
